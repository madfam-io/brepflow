# BrepFlow OCCT.wasm Integration Status

## ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETED: OCCT Integration Framework

### Successfully Integrated Components

#### 1. WASM Module Integration

- **Location**: `packages/engine-occt/wasm/occt.js` (89KB), `occt.wasm` (477KB)
- **Implementation**: OCCT WASM module successfully loaded and initialized
- **API**: Emscripten-generated ExpToCasExe.wasm with `createOCCTModule()` factory function

#### 2. Enhanced BrepFlow Engine Architecture
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Key Updates**:
  - `GeometryAPI` class now defaults to OCCT instead of mock (`useMock = false`)
  - Worker-based architecture supports real OCCT operations with fallback
  - Hybrid implementation: WASM loading + placeholder geometry operations
  - Content-addressed caching system prepared for production geometry data

#### 3. 3D Viewport Integration
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Features**:
  - Real-time tessellation rendering with Three.js
  - Node-specific color coding based on nodeId hashing
  - Automatic camera fitting and scene management
  - WebGL-based geometry visualization pipeline

#### 4. Type Safety & Build System
- **Status**: ✅ **CORE FIXED**
- **Resolved**:
  - MockGeometry implements complete WorkerAPI interface
  - WASM module type declarations with `@ts-ignore` for untyped modules
  - Three.js OrbitControls import via `three-stdlib`
  - Error handling with proper TypeScript `unknown` type annotations
  - DAG engine cache type compatibility

### Technical Architecture

#### OCCT Loading Pipeline
```typescript
// packages/engine-occt/src/occt-bindings.ts
export async function loadOCCT(): Promise<OCCTModule> {
  const createModule = await import('../wasm/occt.js');
  wasmModule = await createModule.createOCCTModule();

  // Placeholder operations that will be replaced with real OCCT C++ API
  return {
    makeBox: async (dx, dy, dz) => generateShapeHandle('solid'),
    tessellate: async (shape, deflection) => generateMockMesh(shape),
    // ... other geometry operations
  };
}
```

#### Worker Integration
```typescript
// packages/engine-occt/src/worker.ts
case 'MAKE_BOX':
  if (isInitialized && occtModule) {
    result = await occtModule.makeBox(params.width, params.height, params.depth);
  } else {
    result = mockGeometry.createBox(params.center, params.width, params.height, params.depth);
  }
```

#### 3D Viewport Pipeline
```typescript
// apps/studio/src/components/Viewport.tsx
const updateSceneGeometry = async () => {
  const geometryNodes = graph.nodes.filter(node =>
    node.outputs?.geometry && node.outputs.geometry.value
  );

  for (const node of geometryNodes) {
    const shapeHandle = node.outputs?.geometry?.value as ShapeHandle;
    const meshData = await dagEngine.geometryAPI.tessellate(shapeHandle.id, 0.1);
    const mesh = createMeshFromTessellation(meshData, node.id);
    geometryGroupRef.current.add(mesh);
  }
};
```

## 🚀 PHASE 2 REQUIRED: Production OCCT Implementation

### Critical Development Tasks

#### 1. Real OCCT C++ API Bindings ⚡ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Current**: Placeholder functions that generate mock geometry
- **Required**: Actual OCCT C++ function calls through Emscripten bindings
- **Files**: `packages/engine-occt/src/occt-bindings.ts`
- **Examples**:
  ```cpp
  // C++ bindings needed:
  TopoDS_Shape makeBox(double dx, double dy, double dz);
  BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh tessellate(TopoDS_Shape& shape, double deflection);
  ```

#### 2. STEP File I/O Implementation 🔧 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Current**: Placeholder STEP import/export
- **Required**: Real STEP file parsing using OCCT STEP libraries
- **Files**: `packages/engine-occt/src/occt-bindings.ts`
- **Dependencies**: OCCT STEP reader/writer modules

#### 3. Advanced Feature Operations 🛠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Current**: Mock implementations in feature nodes
- **Required**: Real OCCT feature operations
- **Files**: `packages/nodes-core/src/features.ts`
- **Operations**: Fillet, Chamfer, Shell, Draft angle operations

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite 🧪 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Current**: Basic development testing
- **Required**: Unit tests for all OCCT operations
- **Coverage**: Geometry creation, boolean operations, tessellation, file I/O
- **Performance**: Memory usage and computation time benchmarks

### Performance Considerations

#### Memory Management
- OCCT shapes must be properly disposed to prevent memory leaks
- Implement reference counting for shared geometry
- Worker-based processing to avoid blocking main thread

#### Caching Strategy
- Content-addressed geometry caching implemented
- Hash-based shape identification for cache hits
- LRU eviction policy for memory management

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Constraints

1. **WASM Module**: ExpToCasExe utility, not full OCCT geometry API
2. **TypeScript**: Some type checking bypassed with `@ts-ignore` for WASM imports
3. **CLI Errors**: Multiple TypeScript issues in CLI package (not blocking core functionality)
4. **Dev Environment**: pnpm version compatibility issues affect development servers

### Technical Debt

1. Mock geometry operations need replacement with real OCCT calls
2. Error handling could be more robust across worker boundaries
3. WASM type declarations need proper module definitions
4. CLI package needs comprehensive TypeScript error resolution
