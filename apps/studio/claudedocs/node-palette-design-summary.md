# Node Palette UI/UX Design - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

**Challenge**: The current NodePanel.tsx only exposes ~50 nodes to users, while the enhanced node registry contains 868+ nodes across 24+ categories. This creates a 95% accessibility gap where the majority of the node library remains hidden from users.
