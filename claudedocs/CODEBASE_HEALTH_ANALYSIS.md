---

## 2. Code Quality & Maintainability

### 📊 **Score: 8/10** ✅ **VERY GOOD**

#### TypeScript Implementation
```typescript
// Excellent type safety example
export interface NodeInstance<I = any, O = any, P = any> {
  id: NodeId;
  type: string;
  inputs: Partial<Record<keyof I, SocketRef | SocketRef[]>>;
  outputs?: Partial<Record<keyof O, any>>;
  params: P;
  state?: Record<string, unknown>;
  dirty?: boolean;
}
```

#### Strengths

- **Interface Design**: Clean, well-documented interfaces
- **ESLint Configuration**: Comprehensive rules with TypeScript integration

#### Component Quality Analysis
- **DAG Engine**: Excellent abstraction with proper error handling

- **Worker System**: Proper Comlink integration for thread safety
- **State Management**: Clean Zustand stores with devtools integration

#### Areas for Improvement
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries missing
- **Console Logging**: Production console.log statements present
- **Comment Coverage**: Inconsistent code documentation
- **Dead Code**: Some unused imports and variables

#### Technical Debt Assessment
- **Low Technical Debt**: Well-structured codebase with clear patterns
- **WASM Placeholders**: Mock implementations need real OCCT bindings
- **Type Safety**: Some `@ts-ignore` for WASM imports (acceptable)

---

## 3. Security & Compliance

### 📊 **Score: 3/10** 🔴 **CRITICAL GAPS**

#### Authentication & Authorization
```
❌ No authentication system present
❌ No user management or sessions
❌ No access control mechanisms
❌ No API security layer
❌ No RBAC or permissions system
```

#### Data Security Issues
- **Client-Side Processing**: All CAD data processed in browser (good for privacy)
- **No Input Validation**: Missing parameter validation in node operations
- **No Rate Limiting**: Worker operations unlimited
- **No Audit Trail**: No logging of user actions or data changes

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- **WASM Memory**: No memory protection for OCCT operations
- **File Upload**: No file type validation or size limits
- **XSS Prevention**: React provides basic protection but no CSP headers
- **Data Exposure**: No sensitive data handling policies

#### Compliance Gaps
- **GDPR**: No privacy policy or data handling procedures
- **Enterprise**: No SSO, LDAP, or enterprise auth integration
- **Audit**: No compliance logging or data retention policies

---

## 4. Performance & Scalability

### 📊 **Score: 7/10** 🟡 **GOOD WITH CONCERNS**

#### Bundle Size Analysis
- **Dependencies**: 452MB `node_modules` (large but typical for CAD app)
- **Code Splitting**: Good Vite configuration with vendor chunking
- **WASM Size**: 477KB OCCT.wasm (reasonable for CAD functionality)

#### Performance Strengths
- **Web Workers**: Heavy computation properly isolated
- **Content Caching**: Hash-based geometry caching system
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and modules loaded on demand
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal patterns for OCCT handles

#### Scalability Concerns
```typescript
// Good: Debounced evaluation
useEffect(() => {
  const dirtyNodes = graph.nodes.filter(n => n.dirty);
  if (dirtyNodes.length > 0) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      evaluateGraph();
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [graph, evaluateGraph]);
```

#### Performance Issues
- **No Virtualization**: Large node graphs may cause UI lag
- **Memory Leaks**: WASM shape disposal not guaranteed
- **Network**: No CDN or asset optimization strategy
- **Browser Limits**: WASM thread limitations for complex operations

#### Optimization Opportunities
- **Progressive Loading**: Large CAD files need streaming
- **LOD System**: Level-of-detail for complex geometries
- **Background Processing**: More computation in Service Workers
- **Caching Strategy**: Browser storage for persistent models
