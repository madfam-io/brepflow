## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas

**Security Implementation (Week 1-2)**
- *Risk*: Authentication vulnerabilities
- *Mitigation*: Security consultant review, automated scanning, penetration testing

**WASM Integration (Week 9)**
- *Risk*: OCCT compilation failures, memory issues
- *Mitigation*: WASM expertise, fallback strategies, phased rollout

**Performance Under Load (Week 8)**
- *Risk*: System degradation at scale
- *Mitigation*: Load testing, performance monitoring, auto-scaling

### Contingency Plans

**Development Delays**
- Buffer time built into each phase (20% padding)
- Parallel development where possible
- Feature scope reduction if needed

**Technical Blockers**
- Expert consultants identified for each domain
- Alternative implementations researched
- Phased rollback procedures prepared

**Resource Constraints**
- Cross-training team members on multiple areas
- External contractor relationships established
- Clear prioritization criteria defined

Specialist Support (as needed):
  - Security Consultant: Weeks 1-2, 4
  - WASM/C++ Engineer: Weeks 9-10
  - QA Engineer: Weeks 2-4, 8
  - UX Designer: Weeks 11-12
```

### Technology Stack Additions
```yaml
New Dependencies:
