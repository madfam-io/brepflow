# BrepFlow Investor Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title
# **BrepFlow**
### The Figma of CAD
*Real-time collaborative parametric design in the browser*

**Series A | Raising $20M**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### 🚫 **CAD is Broken for Modern Teams**

- **No Real Collaboration**: Desktop tools = file conflicts & version chaos
- **Expensive Barriers**: $1,000+ licenses lock out millions
- **Platform Lock-in**: Windows-only tools in a multi-platform world
- **Slow Innovation**: 20-year-old architecture can't adapt

**$8.7B market stuck in the 1990s**

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### ✨ **BrepFlow: Web-Native Parametric CAD**

```
Traditional CAD              BrepFlow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━              ━━━━━━━━
Install 2GB app      →      Open browser
Work alone           →      Collaborate real-time
Save & email files   →      Auto-sync cloud
$1000/year          →      Free to start
Desktop only        →      Any device
```

**10x better distribution, collaboration, and economics**
