# Critical UI/UX Responsive Design Issues - BrepFlow Studio

## Major Problems Identified

### Desktop Issues
- Fixed sidebars (280px, 320px) waste 60%+ screen space on large monitors
- No percentage-based layouts
- Empty viewport areas

### Mobile Critical Failures  
- Single panel only - can't see node editor + viewport together
- Essential controls completely hidden with `hide-mobile` class
- No persistent toolbar/navigation
- Tab switching requires multiple taps

### Core Problems
1. **Fixed widths instead of fluid layouts**
2. **Mobile shows only ONE panel at a time**
3. **Essential controls hidden on mobile devices**
4. **No adaptive layout based on screen size**
5. **Poor touch interactions and gestures**

## Immediate Fixes Required
1. Remove all `hide-mobile` classes
2. Implement split-view for mobile
3. Add persistent toolbar
4. Convert to percentage-based layouts
5. Enable multi-panel mobile views
