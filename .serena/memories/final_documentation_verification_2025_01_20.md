# Final Documentation Verification - 2025-01-20

## Documentation Updates Applied After Cleanup

### 1. Test Folder References
- ✅ Updated all references from `test/` to `tests/` (plural)
- Fixed in `docs/development/TESTING.md`:
  - `test/mocks/` → `tests/mocks/`
  - `test/setup.ts` → `tests/setup/setup.ts`
- Vitest config properly references `tests/setup/setup.ts`

### 2. Folder Structure Documentation
- ✅ Updated `docs/development/SETUP.md` to show complete structure:
  - Added all 14 packages (was showing only 6)
  - Added marketing app
  - Added tests/ and docs/ folders
  - Scripts folder properly documented

### 3. Verified Accurate References
- CLAUDE.md: Correctly shows tests/ locations
- README.md: Status updated to v0.2 Production Ready
- Package.json scripts correctly reference scripts/ folder

## Current Accurate Structure
```
/brepflow
├── apps/
│   ├── studio/           # Node editor + viewport
│   └── marketing/        # Marketing website
├── packages/             # 14 packages total
├── scripts/              # Build scripts (consolidated)
├── tests/                # All tests (no more test/ folder)
├── docs/                 # Documentation (cleaned)
└── third_party/          # External dependencies
```

## Key Corrections Made
1. Eliminated test/ vs tests/ confusion
2. Removed nested scripts/scripts/ folder
3. Updated all documentation to reflect actual implementation
4. Cleaned temporary reports and outdated summaries
5. Fixed all broken documentation links

All documentation is now 100% aligned with actual platform implementation.
