# BrepFlow Production Architecture Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a complete production-ready architecture for BrepFlow that eliminates all mock dependencies and ensures real OCCT geometry operations.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Production App Entry Point
- `App.production.tsx` - Main app without mock fallbacks
- Uses `useProductionGraphStore` hook exclusively
- Includes proper error boundaries and health monitoring
- Shows loading/error states for WASM initialization

### 2. Production Vite Configuration
- `vite.config.production.ts` - Optimized build configuration
- Enforces production environment variables
- Removes all console statements in production
- Proper code splitting and chunking
- Security headers including CSP

### 3. Production Services
- `geometry-service.production.ts` - Real geometry operations only
- `health-service.ts` - Comprehensive health monitoring
- Automatic recovery from failures
- Performance metrics tracking
- Export validation

### 4. Build Infrastructure
- `build-production.sh` - Complete build script
- WASM compilation verification
- Mock reference detection
- Build manifest generation
- Size optimization

### 5. Integration Testing
- `geometry-integration.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- Tests all geometry operations
- Boolean operations validation
- Export format testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Error recovery testing

## Architecture Benefits

### Zero Mock Dependencies
- Production builds contain no MockGeometry references
- Fails fast if real OCCT not available
- Validates all geometry operations
- Ensures manufacturing-grade accuracy

### Health Monitoring
- `/api/health` - Full system health
- `/api/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `/api/health/ready` - Readiness check
- Memory usage tracking
- Worker health monitoring

### Production Safeguards
- Environment variable enforcement
- WASM initialization validation
- Geometry output validation
- Export format verification
- Automatic error recovery

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting by vendor
- Tree shaking and minification
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Worker pooling for geometry ops
- Memory pressure management

## Usage

### Development Mode (with mocks)
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build-production.sh
./scripts/build-production.sh
```

### Production Preview
```bash
./scripts/build-production.sh --preview
```

### Production Testing
```bash
NODE_ENV=production pnpm test
```

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for production deployment with:
- Real OCCT geometry operations
- No mock fallbacks
- Comprehensive health monitoring
- Production error handling
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

## Files Created/Modified
1. `apps/studio/src/App.production.tsx`
2. `apps/studio/vite.config.production.ts`
3. `scripts/build-production.sh`
4. `apps/studio/src/services/geometry-service.production.ts`
5. `apps/studio/src/services/health-service.ts`
6. `tests/geometry-integration.test.ts`

The architecture ensures BrepFlow operates with real, manufacturing-grade geometry in production environments.
