# WASM Deployment Fix Summary

## Root Cause
1. **Build Process Issue**: vercel.json had complex/unreliable dist copy command
2. **WASM File Paths**: Vite hashes WASM files but code expects specific paths
3. **Asset Resolution**: Mismatch between where WASM files are built vs where code looks for them

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed vercel.json**: Simplified build command to properly copy apps/studio/dist
2. **Created Vite Plugin**: vite-plugin-wasm.ts ensures WASM files are copied to /wasm/ directory with original names
3. **Updated OCCT Bindings**: Modified locateFile to check multiple paths (production, dev, fallback)
4. **Enhanced Serverless Function**: studio.js now checks multiple locations for WASM files

## Key Changes
- vercel.json: Simplified build command
- apps/studio/vite-plugin-wasm.ts: New plugin for WASM handling
- apps/studio/vite.config.ts: Added WASM plugin
- packages/engine-occt/src/occt-bindings.ts: Multi-path WASM resolution
- functions/studio.js: Enhanced WASM file serving logic

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to production branch
3. Vercel will rebuild with new configuration
4. WASM files will be properly served with COOP/COEP headers
