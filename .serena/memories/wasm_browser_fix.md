# WASM Browser Fix Applied

## Issue Found:
`Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined` in browser at environment.ts:54

## Root Cause:
The code was using `process.env` which only exists in Node.js, not in browsers.

## Fix Applied:
1. Modified `packages/engine-core/src/config/environment.ts`:
   - Added browser detection
   - Created safe `processEnv` variable that's empty object in browser
   - Replaced all `process.env` references with `processEnv`

2. Modified `packages/engine-occt/src/production-worker.ts`:
   - Added typeof check before accessing process.env

## Result:
- Packages rebuilt successfully
- Browser error should be resolved
- WASM should now load properly in browser

## Next Steps:
Reload http://localhost:5174 and check console for successful WASM initialization
